The former Netherlands and Manchester United coach Louis van Gaal says he has been cured of cancer and is keen for a return to the higher levels of the game.

The 73-year-old told an interviewer three years ago that he had prostate cancer , but on Friday told the same Dutch television talk show: “I’m no longer bothered by cancer.” When he announced his illness, Van Gaal was the coach of the Netherlands and he has not worked since the last World Cup, in Qatar in 2022.

“Two years ago, I had a few operations,” he said. “It was all bad then. But it all worked out in the end. I have check-ups every few months, and that’s going well. I’m getting fitter and fitter.”

Van Gaal, whose career has taken in stints at Ajax , Barcelona, Bayern Munich and United, reiterated a lack of interest in returning to club management but said becoming the coach of a top-tier country could tempt him back. He serves as a special adviser to Ajax.
