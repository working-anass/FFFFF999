A preliminary report by Indian aviation accident investigators said the fatal Air India crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad in June showed the plane engines’ fuel switches shifting from run to cutoff within seconds of each other.

The report also contained information about the pilots discussing the switches.

“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report says.

The investigation into the disaster is continuing.

“At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to Boeing 787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers” India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said.

More than 240 passengers and crew onboard the flight died, as did 19 people on the ground, including five medical students. One passenger, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, survived the crash.

The agency, an office under India’s civil aviation ministry, is leading the investigation into the world’s deadliest aviation accident in a decade.
