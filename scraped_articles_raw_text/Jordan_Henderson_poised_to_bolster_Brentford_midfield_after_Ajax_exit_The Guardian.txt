Jordan Henderson is poised to join Brentford after leaving Ajax. It is understood the 35-year-old England midfielder will return to his home country after agreeing an early exit from his contract with the Dutch side, which still had a year remaining.

The former Liverpool captain, understood to have agreed a two-year deal, is set to bolster the Bees midfield after the departure of Christian Nørgaard, their erstwhile captain, to Arsenal.

Henderson left Liverpool in 2023, having lifted the Premier League trophy alongside winning the Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup and Club World Cup during a 12-year stay at Anfield. However, his move to the Saudi Pro League side Al-Ettifaq was short-lived, and he headed back to Europe with Ajax in January last year.

Despite missing out on England’s squad for Euro 2024, Henderson was brought back into the national team last month by Thomas Tuchel as he plans for the 2026 World Cup.

Brentford are continuing a summer rebuild under their new head coach, Keith Andrews, after the departure of Thomas Frank to Tottenham. The Bees have already signed the goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher from Liverpool and the 20-year-old midfielder Antoni Milambo from Feyenoord, while Michael Kayode’s loan switch from Fiorentina has been made into a permanent move.

The Cameroon winger Bryan Mbeumo remains a target for Manchester United, who last month tabled a bid worth up to £62.5m.
