Stock markets slipped amid confusion as to when – and at what level – new US tariffs would be applied, as Donald Trump’s self-imposed 9 July deadline edged closer.

The US is close to finalising several trade agreements in the coming days and will notify other countries of higher tariff rates by Thursday, the president said on Sunday, with the higher rates to take effect on 1 August.

“President Trump’s going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don’t move things along, then on August 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,” treasury secretary Scott Bessent told CNN.

Trump in April announced a 10% base tariff rate on most countries and higher “reciprocal” rates ranging up to 50%. However, Trump also said levies could range in value from “maybe 60% or 70% tariffs to 10% and 20%”, further clouding the picture.

With very few actual trade deals done, analysts had suspected the date would be pushed out, though it was still not clear if the new deadline applied to all trading partners or just some.
