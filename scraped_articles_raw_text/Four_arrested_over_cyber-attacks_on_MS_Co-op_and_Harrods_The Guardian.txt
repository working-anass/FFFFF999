Four people have been arrested at addresses in the West Midlands, Staffordshire and London as part of an investigation into a trio of cyber-attacks on Marks & Spencer, Co-op and Harrods.

The National Crime Agency said two 19-year-old men, a 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old woman had been apprehended on suspicion of breaching the Computer Misuse Act, blackmail, money laundering and joining the activities of organised crime.

Paul Foster, the head of the NCA’s national cybercrime unit, said: “Since these attacks took place, specialist NCA cybercrime investigators have been working at pace and the investigation remains one of the agency’s highest priorities.

“Today’s arrests are a significant step in that investigation but our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice.”

The arrests were supported by officers from the West Midlands organised crime unit and the East Midlands special operations unit.
