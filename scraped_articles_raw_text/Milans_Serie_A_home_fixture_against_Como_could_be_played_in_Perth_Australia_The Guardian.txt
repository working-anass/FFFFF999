Milan’s home game against Como in the 2025-26 Serie A campaign could become the first major European domestic league fixture played outside its home country, as plans to move the fixture to Australia took a step forward.

Italy’s football federation (FIGC) has given the green light for the match to be played in Perth – some 8,500 miles away from Milan – next February. The proposal moves European football into uncharted territory after previous requests to stage domestic league matches abroad were knocked back by authorities.

The venue switch has been triggered by Winter Olympic Games logistics, with Milan’s San Siro stadium hosting the opening ceremony for the 2026 Games on 6 February – the weekend that the game is scheduled to take place.

“The federal council gave a positive opinion to the Lega Serie A request to play Milan-Como in Perth,” the FIGC said in a statement. “This brings closer what would be a historic trip abroad for a Serie A match.”

The FIGC cautioned that the “complex authorisation procedure” still requires formal approval from a number of governing bodies. Football Australia, Uefa, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and Fifa all have to approve the fixture relocation.

For the last three seasons, the Supercoppa Italiana has been held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Milan lost to Inter in a one-off match in January 2023, with Inter defending their title in the first four-team edition 12 months later. Milan won the last edition, beating Inter 3-2 in January’s final.
