Crystal Palace have agreed a deal to sign Borna Sosa from Ajax for about £3m, with the Croatia defender due to have his medical on Monday.

The 27-year-old, who made 20 appearances on loan at Torino last season, is expected to provide competition for Tyrick Mitchell at left wing-back but is also capable of playing on the opposite flank. Palace signed Ben Chilwell on loan in January but he has returned to Chelsea.

Sosa, who helped Croatia to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2022, has three years on his contract at Ajax but has reportedly been told he is not part of the new manager John Heitinga’s plans.

Palace have signed the Argentina goalkeeper Walter Benítez from PSV on a free and are understood to remain in talks with Sporting over a potential £45m move for the Ivory Coast defender Ousmane Diomande. That could depend on the future of Marc Guéhi, with Liverpool believed to be the frontrunners to sign the England defender, whose contract expires next summer.
