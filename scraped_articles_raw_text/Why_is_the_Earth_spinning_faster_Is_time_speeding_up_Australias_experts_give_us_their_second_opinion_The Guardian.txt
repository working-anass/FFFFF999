Time flies, and three days in July and August could flit by faster than usual this year – but only if your clocks are set to astronomical time.

A standard Earth day is 86,400 seconds. But on 9 July, 22 July and 5 August, scientists expect the planet’s rotation to quicken relative to the sun , truncating the days by a millisecond or more.

In this period of great acceleration, is time itself now speeding up? And will global timekeepers have to skip a second to keep things tidy?
