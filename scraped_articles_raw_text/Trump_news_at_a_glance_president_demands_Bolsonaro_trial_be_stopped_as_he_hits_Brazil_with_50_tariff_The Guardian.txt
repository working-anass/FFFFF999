Donald Trump has slapped a 50% tariff on Brazil over what he called the “witch-hunt” against former president Jair Bolsonaro and demanded that it end immediately.

The US president said the levy on Brazil would be “separate from all sectoral tariffs” as he also targeted seven other countries for steep tariffs and criticised the trial of Bolsonaro, whom he has described as a friend and hosted at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

The US supreme court, meanwhile, denied a request by Florida officials to lift a judge’s order barring them from carrying out arrests of undocumented US immigrants entering the state while a legal challenge plays out.

And the Trump’s administration has issued sanctions against Francesca Albanese, a UN official investigating abuses in Gaza in the latest US effort to punish critics of Israel’s war in the territory.
