The CEO of X, Elon Musk’s social network, announced on Wednesday she would step down after two years in the role.

Linda Yaccarino wrote: “When @elonmusk and I first spoke of his vision for X , I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the extraordinary mission of this company. I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.”

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, purchased Twitter in 2022 and later renamed it X.
