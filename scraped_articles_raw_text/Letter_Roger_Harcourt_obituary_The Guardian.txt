Title: Letter: Roger Harcourt obituary
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/09/letter-roger-harcourt-obituary

In 1964-65 Roger Harcourt was my O-level English teacher at Glyn grammar school in Epsom, Surrey. His youthfulness came as a breath of fresh air, as he took up his first school teaching post after leaving Reading University.

It was a joy to read how his life and career had subsequently proceeded, notably through promoting literature and drama at Ward Freman school, now Freman college, in Buntingford, Hertfordshire. Indeed, he was the only teacher about whom I ever wondered what became of him.

However, I would like to correct the obituary regarding his Shakespeare summer camps at Stratford. They did not start in the 1970s, as we at Glyn enjoyed the beginning of this enterprise.
