Title: Zombie pensioners: ageism never dies
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/20/zombie-pensioners-ageism-never-dies

I was somewhat perturbed to read the article headed “ Third of Britons confess to ageist discrimination ” (19 August) and to then read overleaf the report “ Wheatley offers zombie pensioners in generation divide satire ”. Ageist portrayals clearly continue to be commissioned on TV. This forthcoming series for Channel 4 will cast young people as “heroes [who] need to take on the old flesh-eating zombies”, thereby fuelling fears of growing old and attributing wholescale blame to a generation for the social and political ills of the present. Theresa Buckland Brighton

Well done, Suzanne Moore ( G2 , 20 August). Not only is the Today programme obsolete, it affects the wellbeing of our household. Since banning it I feel so much happier, and am better informed. Sally Bates Cotgrave, Nott inghamshire

Your piece about the stick insects giving up sex after becoming British ( Report , 20 August) was very funny and the name Clitarchus hookeri was inspired, but you are rather too late for an April fool joke. Barry Ramshaw Bristol

Re rugby and diversity ( Letters , 20 August), in Lancashire in the 50s and 60s what you played depended on which school you went to. Grammar schools played union and secondary moderns played league. John Trayner London

Paul Dacre is to describe how he helped to shape modern Britain ( Channel 4 signs Dacre to dissect Mail and the UK , 19 August). At last, someone ready to take the blame. Hugh Edwards Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria
