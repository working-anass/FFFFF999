Two care home residents have died after a car being chased by police crashed into their building in Sunderland.

Ten residents were taken to hospital after the stolen BMW collapsed a large part of a wall and part of the first storey of Highcliffe care home, in Witherwack.

The care home was evacuated after the crash, which happened at about 9.40pm on Wednesday.

All but one of the injured residents have now been discharged, Northumbria police said on Friday morning.

Two men, both aged 21, who had previously been questioned, were re-arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the deaths.

Both were originally arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, while one was also arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.

They remain in police custody.

Following the police pursuit, a mandatory referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, the force said, the standard procedure in cases involving police pursuit.

Northumbria police said: “Sadly, two care home residents – a woman in her 90s and a woman in her 80s – passed away yesterday. The next of kin for both women have been notified and are being supported by specially trained officers.

“Following this sad update, the investigation will now also consider whether the collision contributed to their deaths.”

Ch Supt Mark Hall, of Northumbria police, said: “This is an extremely sad development and all of our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of everyone affected. We will continue to support them in any way that we can at this time. Our investigations remain at an early stage, and we would ask people to avoid speculation both online and in the community.”

Police urged anyone who may have information about the crash to contact them.
