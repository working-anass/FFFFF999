Tottenham have reached an agreement to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £54.5m.

Kudus is due to undergo a medical on Thursday and will sign a six-year deal. The Ghana attacker will become the first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker in 2011.

West Ham’s decision to sell Kudus to their London rivals is down to their needing to revamp their squad without inviting a potential breach of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations. Sources at the London Stadium are adamant that West Ham must sell to buy . They want a goalkeeper, a left centre-back, a left wing-back, at least two midfielders and a striker.

Kudus had an £85m release clause valid for Premier League sides for the first 10 days of July but West Ham were always likely to accept a lower fee. He was deemed the club’s most sellable asset and has attracted plenty of interest. Spurs have made the strongest push for the 24-year-old and had a £50m bid rejected last week. The payment is to be spread over three years.

West Ham are comfortable with allowing Kudus to leave, reasoning that he is best playing on the right – the same position as the captain, Jarrod Bowen. Graham Potter does not feel that Kudus is capable of playing in a central role in the Premier League.

Kudus impressed after joining West Ham from Ajax for £37m two years ago but struggled last season. He clashed with Potter’s predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and managed four goals in all competitions. He served a lengthy ban after a red card during a 4-1 defeat by Spurs last October.

That dismissal has not stopped Tottenham from going for him. Kudus will boost Thomas Frank’s options in the final third and his arrival represents a show of intent as Spurs look to rebuild after replacing Ange Postecoglou with the Dane.
