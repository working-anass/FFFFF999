Rather than launching a “blitz” on asylum seekers working illegally, the government should allow them to work legally ( Home Office announces ‘nationwide blitz’ on asylum seekers taking jobs, 5 July ).

An investigation by the Commission on the Integration of Refugees found that providing free English classes on arrival, involving local councils and communities in resettling refugees and allowing asylum seekers to work if their claims remain undecided after six months would yield a net benefit to the economy of £1.2bn within five years ( Proper jobs, English classes and a refugee minister – this is how to fix Britain’s asylum system, 20 March 2024 ).

The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, suggests the availability of jobs is a “pull factor”. But the proposal would only bring the UK in line with most other European countries. EU law requires member states to allow asylum seekers to work after nine months , which will be reduced to six months next year. In many countries it is already six months, and in others it is less – in Germany it’s three months, in Italy and Greece, it’s two. Pete Winstanley Durham
