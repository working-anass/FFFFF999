Tottenham are poised to sign Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest after triggering a £60m release clause. The England midfielder is expected to undergo a medical on Friday and could complete the move in the next 24 hours.

Gibbs-White has also attracted interest from Manchester City since excelling at Forest, whom he joined from boyhood club Wolves in 2022 for an initial £25m in a deal that was worth up to £42.5m.

Spurs, who have also agreed to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, have already signed the 20-year-old Japanese defender Kota Takai from J League side Kawasaki Frontale.

The France forward Mathys Tel, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Spurs, was Thomas Frank’s first permanent signing after arriving from Bayern Munich.

Tottenham have tracked the Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze, the Brentford pair Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa and Southampton’s Tyler Dibling. Spurs are thought to be at the front of the queue to sign Dibling, who enjoyed a breakthrough campaign despite relegation.

Gibbs-White scored seven goals and added eight assists in 34 Premier League games last season. The 25-year-old is expected to sign a long-term contract at Spurs. Forest are also expected to lose Anthony Elanga, with a £55m move to Newcastle imminent.
