Donald Trump has voiced his irritation with Vladimir Putin , telling a cabinet meeting he was getting increasingly frustrated with the Russian leader.

The US president told the televised meeting of top officials: “We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth. He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”
