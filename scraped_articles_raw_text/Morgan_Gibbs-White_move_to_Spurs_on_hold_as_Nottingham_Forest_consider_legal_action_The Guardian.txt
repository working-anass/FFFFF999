Morgan Gibbs-White’s anticipated £60m move to Tottenham is on hold because Nottingham Forest are considering legal action over an alleged illegal approach for the player.

Forest are also preparing a complaint to the Premier League , arguing that Spurs’s conduct surrounding the proposed transfer has been inappropriate. It had been expected that Gibbs-White would undergo a medical on Friday before completing the move.

Forest are consulting lawyers about possible legal action because they believe they have not granted Spurs permission to speak with Gibbs-White and also feel there has been a breach in confidentiality regarding the release clause in the England midfielder’s contract.

Spurs, who signed Mohammed Kudus from West Ham on Thursday, still plan to proceed with the deal as they look to boost Thomas Frank’s squad. This summer they have also tracked the Crystal Palace and England midfielder Eberechi Eze, who is wanted by their rivals Arsenal, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo and Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

Forest and Tottenham declined to comment when contacted. Forest consider the deal to be off but their anger may delay and not veto the move.
