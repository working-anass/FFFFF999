Arsenal have reached an agreement to sign Noni Madueke from Chelsea for £52m.

The England winger has already agreed terms on a five-year deal and is likely to complete a move to the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal , who are also expected to ramp up their pursuit of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze, have been looking to add more depth on the flanks and have acted quickly after identifying Madueke as a key target.

The 23-year-old’s appeal lies in his ability to provide cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and offer an option for Mikel Arteta on the left. Madueke has decided to seek a new challenge with his hopes of regular football at Chelsea limited by them adding Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens, Estêvão and João Pedro to their attack this summer. Geovany Quenda is due to join from Sporting Lisbon next year.

Chelsea need to generate revenue through sales after being fined by default for breaching financial fair play rules last week. Selling Madueke, who joined from PSV Eindhoven in January 2023, for a profit will boost their financial position.

Chelsea believe that Madueke has not progressed enough. He has had a bit part role at the Club World Cup and us unlikely to be involved in Sunday’s final against Paris Saint-Germain.
