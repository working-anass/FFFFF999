- The US has resumed military supplies to Ukraine and senior officials in Kyiv will work on military cooperation next week with Washington’s special envoy, Keith Kellogg, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Friday. He restated that Ukraine had received high-level signals from Washington and its other western allies that arms supplies, paused for a time last week , had now resumed. “We are currently working with partners on new supplies, increased weapons production in Ukraine and better support for our army,” he said. “Next week, we will continue working with the US side on a military level … We are also preparing new European defence packages.” Kellogg, interviewed by the Ukrainian media outlet Novyny.LIVE while attending a conference about Ukraine in Rome, said: “We’ll be in Kyiv Monday. We’ll be there all week.”

- Donald Trump confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine, Andrew Roth writes . During an interview with NBC News, the US president said: “So what we’re doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons.” He added: “I’m disappointed in Russia, but we’ll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.”

- The EU’s top diplomat has said the 27-nation bloc was pondering a new raft of sanctions against Moscow. “Russia has increased its attacks against civilians to really cause as much pain … and that’s unacceptable,” the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said. Brussels was considering an 18th round of sanctions against Moscow and “we are also still in negotiations to put the oil price cap on, that would deprive Russia from the means to fund this war”, she told AFP.

- Kallas said she was assured by Laos’s top diplomat that Vientiane had “no intention or willingness” to send military help to Russia, following claims that Moscow was planning to involve military personnel from Laos to bolster its efforts in Ukraine . “I also expressed that it has consequences for European aid to Laos if something like this is happening,” Kallas said. “If you [Laos] contribute to that existential threat, we can’t have good cooperation,” she warned.

- Ukrainian drone and shelling attacks killed three people in Russia on Friday. Russian air defence systems intercepted 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, Moscow said. There was one dead in Russia’s Lipetsk region and another was killed in the western Tula region from the drone attacks, local officials said. Ukrainian shelling later killed another civilian in the border region of Belgorod, the governor announced. The Russian defence ministry said out of the 155 downed Ukrainian drones, 11 were bound for Moscow.

- Ukraine said its drones struck a Russian fighter aircraft plant in the Moscow region and a missile production facility in the Tula region, causing explosions and fires at both. Ukraine’s military said on Telegram the aviation facility in the town of Lukhovitsy, about 135km (84 miles) south-east of Moscow, produced MiG fighters. The other site was the Instrument Design Bureau, which specialised in producing anti-aircraft missiles and missile-gun systems, it said. “Defence forces continue to take all steps to undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian occupiers,” the military said.

- Russian bombardments on eastern Ukraine overnight on Friday forced the evacuation of a maternity centre in Kharkiv and wounded nine people. Zelenskyy said a medical facility was hit in the attack on the country’s second-largest city. “Among the wounded are women in a maternity hospital – mothers with newborns, women recovering from surgery,” he wrote on social media. “Fortunately, no children were injured.” He added that several other regions were attacked overnight.

- Nato will need more long-range missiles in its arsenal to deter Russia from attacking Europe because Moscow is expected to increase production of long-range weapons, a US army general told Reuters. “The Russian army is bigger today than it was when they started the war in Ukraine,” Maj Gen John Rafferty said at a US military base in Wiesbaden, Germany. “And we know that they’re going to continue to invest in long-range rockets and missiles and sophisticated air defences. So more alliance capability is really, really important.”

- The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that wartime censorship in Russia is justified amid the conflict with Ukraine and the closure of opposition-minded media. Speaking to Russian magazine Expert, Peskov said that many media outlets have been closed, while some reporters have left the country in the past three years. “But don’t forget the situation we are in. Now is the time of military censorship, unprecedented for our country. After all, the war is going on in the information space too,” Peskov told the magazine. Russian authorities also blocked X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. “It would be wrong to turn a blind eye to the media that are deliberately engaged in discrediting Russia,” he said.
