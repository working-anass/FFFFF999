The singer Chris Brown has denied further charges over an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub.

The American musician pleaded not guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Abraham Diaw at the Tape venue, a private members’ club in Hanover Square, Mayfair, on 19 February 2023. He also denied having an offensive weapon, a bottle, in a public place.

His co-defendant, Omololu Akinlolu, a US national, on Friday denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They sat side by side in the dock, looking straight ahead during the hearing at Southwark crown court.

About 20 fans sat in the public gallery behind the dock, with several gasping as the singer walked into court. A trial lasting five to seven days is due to start on 26 October 2026.

Brown denied the more serious charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm at a previous hearing.

He was able to continue with his scheduled international tour after he was freed on conditional bail in May.

The singer had to pay a £5m security fee to the court as part of the bail agreement, designed to ensure he returns to court. The sum may be forfeited if he breaches bail conditions.

Brown was arrested at the Lowry hotel in Manchester at 2am on 15 May by Metropolitan police detectives. He is said to have flown to Manchester airport on a private jet in preparation for the UK tour dates.

He was released from HMP Forest Bank in Salford, Greater Manchester, on 21 May. Shortly after, Brown posted an Instagram story referencing his upcoming tour that said: “FROM THE CAGE TO THE STAGE!!! BREEZYBOWL.”
