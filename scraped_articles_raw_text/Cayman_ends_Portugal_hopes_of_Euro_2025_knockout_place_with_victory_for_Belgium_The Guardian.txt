Belgium’s Tessa Wullaert and Janice Cayman struck in a dramatic 2-1 victory in their final Group B game at Euro 2025 on Friday that extinguished Portugal’s dreams of advancing to their first European knockout round.

Belgium, who had already been eliminated from quarter-final contention before kick-off, finished third in Group B, while Portugal, who needed a win to advance, were fourth. Spain and Italy both went through after the world champions won their match 3-1 .

Belgium had a dream start as Wullaert struck in the third minute after Jill Janssens raced down the right flank before slotting a low cross to the captain. Wullaert steered her shot into the far corner past the goalkeeper Patrícia Morais.

Portugal were relieved when Mariam Toloba’s goal for Belgium was chalked off for a foul on Andreia Jacinto in the buildup, after the referee Tess Olofsson reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor.

Telma Encarnação equalised in the 87th minute to breathe some hope into the Portuguese team.

Amber Tysiak thought she had restored Belgium’s lead in stoppage time but her effort was ruled out for offside after a VAR review. But Cayman sealed Belgium’s victory with a 96th-minute goal when she pounced on a loose ball and fired home.
