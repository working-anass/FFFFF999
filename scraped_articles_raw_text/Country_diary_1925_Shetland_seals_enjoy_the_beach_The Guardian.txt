D UNROSSNESS: Nearly 10 o’clock – summer time, remember – and the sun, glowing red through a thin veil of cloud, is still high above the misty horizon. Fitful Head is just visible, 900ft, or more tops the cloud zone. Foula, with its 1,200 foot cliff, and still higher Sneug , has vanished, though it showed dimly through the shimmering heat mist at noon. And it has been hot, hotter than the Shetlanders usually experience; sun and wind are drying their blue peats well.

The seals enjoyed it on the stacks and little beach of Shunni Wick. How many were there? Hard to say, but at one time 117 were ashore; and others rolling in the cool water. Perhaps a dozen, certainly not a score, were the small, round-headed common seals, the rest were greys, some eight-foot giants, others infants, snuggling up to their big mothers for light refreshment. The grey seal is the seal of Shetland – grey in name, but not necessarily in colour, for some are black, others nearly white, and many mottled and marked with light and dark browns. How they play in the breaking Atlantic rollers, how they wallow on the sand to dry themselves in the sun! Yet sportsmen shoot these beautiful creatures; I wonder why?
