            <p>Western Australia police are ruling out foul play as they continue searching for missing German backpacker Carolina Wilga , saying they believe she may have walked into inhospitable bush after her van broke down.</p><p>Police on Thursday found Wilga’s abandoned Mitsubishi van about 150km from Beacon in the Karroun Hill area, which has been described as remote and inhospitable country.</p><p>The van is believed to have suffered mechanical issues, and police believe Wilga may have walked away from her vehicle.</p><ul><li>Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</li></ul><p>The 26-year-old last had contact with friends on 29 June after travelling through the towns of Toodyay and Dowerin, south-west of Beacon, earlier in the day.</p><p>Acting Insp Jessica Securo said that an inexperienced person could easily become lost in the remote location.</p><p>“The terrain is outback country and there are large, rocky outcrops,” she told ABC News on Friday.</p><p>“So although there’s a number of tracks, you can see how it would be easy to become lost or disorientated in that area if you didn’t know it well.”</p><p>Securo said Wilga’s vehicle was located at least about 35km from any main tracks.</p><p>Police are using aircraft to search for Wilga due to the difficult terrain.</p><p>“The search has resumed in that Karroun Hill area. It will be concentrating around her vehicle and tracks that offshoot that area,” Securo said.</p><p>“Our aerial support is our best chances of finding her.”</p><p>Forensic officers are inspecting the van to determine why it was abandoned and what Wilga may have been able to carry with her after she left it.</p><p>“It appears that as she was driving, she’s likely to [have] become lost, and then the car has suffered mechanical issues … and [she] has potentially walked away from her vehicle,” Securo said.</p><p>She said that Wilga’s van was “self-sufficient” and that she had solar panels and water, but that the vehicle was mechanically unable to be used when it was found.</p><p>Police do not believe Wilga was the victim of foul play or met with any other person.</p>
