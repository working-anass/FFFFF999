            <p>A 19-year-old surfer has been found safe on a remote island off the northern NSW coast after his dad posted an urgent plea requesting “boats, beach walkers, drones and 4WDs” to help find the missing teenager.</p><ul><li>Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</li></ul><p>Darcy Deefholts’ family were “fearing for the worst”, his father, Terry, said in an urgent post to Facebook calling for rescue help on Wednesday night.</p><p>The 19-year-old surfer had left his home in Wooli on a bike about 2.30pm yesterday, heading towards Wooli beach, NSW police said. When he didn’t return home, his family contacted police.</p><p>“Following a land and water search around Wooli beach including local police, PolAir, Marine Area Command and Marine Rescue, the man was located safe today on a small island off Wooli,” NSW police said.</p><p>Police later confirmed the teenager was found in the North Solitary Island Nature Reserve, around 14km off the coast.</p><p>In Terry’s post last night, the teenager’s father called on “anyone with a seaworthy vessel to please meet me at the main Wooli boat ramp and take me to sea to help with the search”.</p><p>“HELP - I NEED BOATS, BEACH WALKERS, DRONES AND 4WDs and PLANES AT FIRST LIGHT,” he wrote.</p><p>“As far as we can tell, Darcy took a cream Malibu surfboard with him to One Tree at Wooli and went for a surf in very small swell some time around 4pm. We think he was wearing a dark rashy.</p><p>“Of course we are fearing the worst … We are overwhelmed by the community efforts in the search so far. There is only one thing we want now – our beloved boy to be found safe.</p><p>In a comment on the post, Terry said it was “encouraging to know the water temp is 20 degrees and survivable”.</p><img src="images/4416_2729098724271892021.jpg" alt="North Solitary Island on the NSW north coast." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">North Solitary Island on the NSW north coast.Photograph: James Woodford/The Guardian</p><p>In comments to the Daily Telegraph following Darcy’s rescue, Terry said he was still processing everything and had not slept.</p><p>“I haven’t had the chance to talk to him yet, I’m just so over the moon,” he told the paper, adding that it was “one in a million miracle”.</p><img src="images/8612_7034281830013745997.jpg" alt="Wooli beach in northern New South Wales." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Wooli beach in northern New South Wales.Photograph: Janine Israel/The Guardian</p>
