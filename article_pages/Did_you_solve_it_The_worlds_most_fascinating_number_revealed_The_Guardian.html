            <p>Earlier today I set three puzzles, and also explained why 108 is possibly the most fascinating number in the universe.</p><p>Here are some more reasons:</p><p>108 = 6 2 + 6 2 + 6 2</p><p>108 is the smallest number that can be written as the sum of a square and a cube in two different ways. (108 = 2 3 + 10 2 = 3 3 + 9 2 )</p><p>Many ratios in Moon-Sun-Earth astronomy seem to be around 108: the distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 108 times the diameter of the Sun; The distance between the Earth and the Moon is about 108 times the diameter of the Moon.</p><p>The upper frequency of FM radio is 108Mhz.</p><p>(Examples taken from the book Exploring the Beauty of Fascinating Numbers by Shyam Sunder Gupta. For more reasons click here.)</p><p>Here are the puzzles again with solutions.</p><p>1. Brilliant billions</p><p>You have ten cards. On each of the cards is one of the digits 0 to 9. When you arrange the cards in a line you get a number between 0123456789 and 987654321</p><p>i) How many of these numbers are divisible by 2?</p><p>ii) How many are divisible by 3?</p><p>Solution . i) half of them, ii) all of them!</p><p>The sum of the digits 0-9 is 45, which is divisible by three, hence all numbers made from these ten digits are divisible by three.</p><p>2. How low can you go?</p><p>What is the smallest even number between 1000 and 9999 written with four different digits?</p><p>Solution 1024</p><p>Most people will try to use the three lowest digits, i.e 1032. I hope you didn’t fall into that trap.</p><p>3. All about me</p><p>An autobiographical number is one where the first digit describes how many 0s it has, the second digit describes how many 1s it has, and so on, so that the ( n + 1)th digit describes how many n’ s it has. For example, 1210 is an autobiographical number because it has 1 zero, 2 ones, 1 two and 0 threes.</p><p>Find the only ten digit autobiographical number.</p><p>Solution 6210001000</p><p>Let the solution be ABCDEFGHIJ.</p><p>Each digit n + 1 describes how many times digit n appears. Since there are only ten possible positions for digits, we can deduce that A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H + I + J = 10.</p><p>Let’s proceed by trial and error. Image A = 9. Then J = 1, since there is a single 9 in the number. But that means A &lt; 9, so we have a contradiction.</p><p>Let A = 8. Then I is 1, which means B = 1, which means A &lt;8, so this doesnt work either.</p><p>Let A = 7. Then H = 1, so B must be either 1 or 2. (Since the digits must add up to ten.) If B = 1, then another digit must be 1, but this would mean B = 3, (since thee are three 1s) which is a contradiction. If B = 2, then C = 1 and we have another contridiction.</p><p>Following this logic, we finally hit a solution that works when A = 6.</p><p>I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me .</p><p>Sources of today’s puzzles: 1) Leon Gelkoff, 2) SmartFriends, a daily IQ challenge, smartfriends.app.link 3) An old classic.</p>
