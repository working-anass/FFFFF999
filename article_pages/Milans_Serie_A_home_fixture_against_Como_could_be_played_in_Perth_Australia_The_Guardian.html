            <p>Milan’s home game against Como in the 2025-26 Serie A campaign could become the first major European domestic league fixture played outside its home country, as plans to move the fixture to Australia took a step forward.</p><p>Italy’s football federation (FIGC) has given the green light for the match to be played in Perth – some 8,500 miles away from Milan – next February. The proposal moves European football into uncharted territory after previous requests to stage domestic league matches abroad were knocked back by authorities.</p><p>The venue switch has been triggered by Winter Olympic Games logistics, with Milan’s San Siro stadium hosting the opening ceremony for the 2026 Games on 6 February – the weekend that the game is scheduled to take place.</p><p>“The federal council gave a positive opinion to the Lega Serie A request to play Milan-Como in Perth,” the FIGC said in a statement. “This brings closer what would be a historic trip abroad for a Serie A match.”</p><p>The FIGC cautioned that the “complex authorisation procedure” still requires formal approval from a number of governing bodies. Football Australia, Uefa, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and Fifa all have to approve the fixture relocation.</p><p>For the last three seasons, the Supercoppa Italiana has been held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Milan lost to Inter in a one-off match in January 2023, with Inter defending their title in the first four-team edition 12 months later. Milan won the last edition, beating Inter 3-2 in January’s final.</p>
