            <p>I rarely go out without my binoculars. When I do, I feel rather tense, in case an unusual bird should appear. But I decided that a stroll through Gravesend with my two-year-old grandson was unlikely to test my birding skills.</p><p>On the way, I showed Sammy the usual sparrows, starlings, feral pigeons and a flock of black-headed gulls loafing about on the Thames foreshore. Then I noticed that some had a blacker head than their familiar cousins, and their wings were not tipped with black, but pure white. These features, along with their blood-red bill, made them look like a black-headed gull with a makeover.</p><p>They were, of course, Mediterranean gulls . Back in Somerset, this is a scarce visitor – I’ve seen just one this year on my coastal patch. But in Kent they are common residents, and we now see them every time we visit Sammy’s favourite playground.</p><p>The species’ name is misleading, as Mediterranean gulls are not especially common around the Med. When I began birding, they mainly bred near the Black Sea, and were considered globally threatened. But in recent decades they have spread north and west to colonise Britain.</p><p>Yet unlike other newish arrivals, such as the collared dove, Cetti’s warbler and great white egret, they have stayed under the radar – probably because people tend to lump them into the catch-all category “seagull”. So next time you are visiting a seaside town in southern England, look out for these attractive birds.</p>
