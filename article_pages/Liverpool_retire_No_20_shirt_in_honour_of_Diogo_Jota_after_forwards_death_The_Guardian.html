            <p>Liverpool have permanently retired their No 20 shirt in honour of Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash alongside his brother, André Silva, last week. The club have announced that the No 20 will no longer be used across all levels of the club, including the men’s team, the women’s team and through academy levels.</p><p>The tribute, the first in Liverpool’s history, is a reflection of how valued the Portugal international was as a player and a person at the club. Liverpool fans have called for the retirement of the No 20 shirt since the 28-year-old and his brother died in north-western Spain. Liverpool deliberately timed the announcement at 20:20 BST on Friday.</p><p>The decision to retire the shirt was made after consultation with Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, and parents, Isabel and Joaquim, who travelled to Merseyside on Friday to witness the outpouring of affection for the striker and the tributes left outside Anfield. Jota’s family were accompanied to the stadium by the entire Liverpool squad as they made their first public appearance since the tragic accident.</p><p>Jota died just 11 days after his marriage to his long-term partner and left behind three young children. He and his brother were understood to be driving to Santander to take a ferry back to England before pre-season training, having been advised not to fly following a recent lung procedure.</p><p>Liverpool will play their first game since the accident at Preston on Sunday, when both clubs will pay a number of tributes to Jota and his brother. Liverpool’s anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone, will be played before kick-off and there will be a minute’s silence at Deepdale, where both sets of players will wear black armbands.</p>
