            <p>Leaders from India, the United States and Taiwan offered their support to Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama , on his 90th birthday on Sunday, a landmark anniversary raising geopolitical questions for the future.</p><p>Tibetans fear China will eventually name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering Beijing’s control over Tibet , the territory it poured troops into in 1950 and has ruled ever since.</p><p>The man who calls himself a “simple Buddhist monk” celebrated in India , where he has lived since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital, Lhasa, in 1959.</p><p>The Dalai Lama says only his India-based office has the right to identify his eventual successor .</p><p>“I join 1.4 billion Indians in extending our warmest wishes to His Holiness the Dalai Lama on his 90th birthday,” the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said in a statement, read at celebrations in the Himalayan hill town where the Dalai Lama lives.</p><p>“He has been an enduring symbol of love, compassion, patience and moral discipline,” he added.</p><p>China insisted on Wednesday that it would have the final say on who succeeds the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p><p>Modi’s effusive support is significant.</p><p>India and China are intense rivals competing for influence across south Asia, but have sought to repair ties after a 2020 border clash.</p><p>The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, also said in a statement, read at the celebrations in India, that Washington was “committed to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans”.</p><p>“We support efforts to preserve Tibetans’ distinct linguistic, cultural and religious heritage, including their ability to freely choose and venerate religious leaders without interference,” the statement added.</p><p>Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te – who leads an island that China says is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to seize – said in a statement read at the ceremony that the example set by the Dalai Lama “resonates with all who cherish freedom, democracy and respect for human rights”.</p><p>Messages from three former US presidents were also broadcast.</p><p>“At a time when we see the forces of division tearing at the fabric of our common humanity … I’m grateful for your enduring efforts to build a better, kinder, more compassionate world,” Bill Clinton said.</p><p>“The world is a troubled place, and we need your spirit of kindness and compassion and love more than ever,” George W Bush added.</p><p>Barack Obama wished a “very happy birthday to the youngest 90-year-old I know”.</p><p>“It is humbling to realise that you’ve been a leader on the world stage for longer than I’ve been alive,” Obama said, in his message to his “dear friend”.</p><p>“You’ve shown generations what it means to practise compassion, and speak up for freedom and dignity,” Obama added. “Not bad for someone who describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk.”</p>
