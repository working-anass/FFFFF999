I’d fallen down the stairs and a bit of metal went through my jaw – I remember screaming as the doctor stitched me up.</p><p>What would your superpower be? I can sleep any time, any place, anywhere.</p><p>What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? Self-flagellation.</p><p>What is the trait you most deplore in others? Bullying.</p><p>Describe yourself in three words Loyal, relentless, goofy.</p><p>Who would play you in the film of your life? Am I allowed three? Zoë Kravitz, Halle Berry and Zoe Saldaña.</p><p>Which words or phrases do you most overuse? Mate.</p><p>What was your most embarrassing moment? I was 17 and about to go on a first date with my first boyfriend. I was so desperate for my mum not to meet him that I was trying to get to the door before she did. I ran down the stairs as she opened it, and slid down the last five steps on my arse.</p><p>What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you? It would be a racist comment.</p><p>Would you choose fame or anonymity? Anonymity.</p><p>What do you owe your parents? A good work ethic.</p><p>What is the worst job you’ve done? Double-glazing sales when I was about 16 – on the phone, cold calling. Horrendous.</p><p>What has been your biggest disappointment? Not being a scratch golfer.</p><p>If you could edit your past, what would you change? All the times I was mean to someone.</p><p>When did you last cry, and why? The FA Cup final, watching Crystal Palace win.</p><p>What single thing would improve the quality of your life? Being able to cram the quality of eight hours’ sleep into four.</p><p>Would you rather have more sex, money or fame? Sex.</p><p>What is the most important lesson life has taught you? Worry about the things you can control and don’t worry about the things you can’t.</p><p>Tell us a secret Everything I do has to be done in whole numbers or groups of five. So, if I’m on the running machine, I have to finish on a multiple of five time wise or distance wise.</p><p>How would you like to be remembered? By my friends and loved ones as someone who loved ferociously and always had their back.</p>
