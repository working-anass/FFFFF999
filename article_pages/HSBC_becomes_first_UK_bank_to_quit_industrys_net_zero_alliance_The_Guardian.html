            <p>HSBC has become the first UK bank to leave the global banking industry’s net zero target-setting group, as campaigners warned it was a “troubling” sign over the lender’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis.</p><p>The move risks triggering further departures from the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) by UK banks, in a fresh blow to international climate coordination efforts.</p><p>HSBC’s decision follows a wave of exits by major US banks in the run-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. His return to the White House has spurred a climate backlash as he pushes for higher production of oil and gas .</p><p>HSBC was a founding member of the NZBA at its launch in 2021, with the bank’s then chief executive, Noel Quinn, saying it was vital to “establish a robust and transparent framework for monitoring progress” towards net zero carbon-emission targets.</p><p>“We want to set that standard for the banking industry. Industry-wide collaboration is essential in achieving that goal,” Quinn said .</p><p>Convened by the UN environment programme’s finance initiative but led by banks, the NZBA commits members to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 or earlier.</p><p>Six of the largest banks in the US – Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – left the NZBA after Trump was elected.</p><p>UK lenders including Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, Standard Chartered and Nationwide were still listed as members as of Friday afternoon .</p><p>HSBC’s decision to leave the alliance comes just months after it announced it was delaying key parts of its climate goals by 20 years and watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.</p><p>The climate campaign group ShareAction condemned the move, saying it was “yet another troubling signal around the bank’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis”.</p><p>Jeanne Martin, ShareAction’s co-director of corporate engagement, said: “It sends a counterproductive message to governments and companies, despite the multiplying financial risks of global heating and the heatwaves, floods and extreme weather it will bring.</p><p>“Investors will be watching closely how this backsliding move will translate into its disclosures and policies.”</p><p>HSBC said in a statement “We recognise the role the Net Zero Banking Alliance has played in developing guiding frameworks to help banks establish their initial target-setting approach.</p><p>“With this foundation in place, we have decided to withdraw from the NZBA as we work towards updating and implementing our own net zero transition plan.</p><p>“We remain resolutely focused on supporting our customers to finance their transition objectives and on making progress towards our net zero by 2050 ambition.”</p>
