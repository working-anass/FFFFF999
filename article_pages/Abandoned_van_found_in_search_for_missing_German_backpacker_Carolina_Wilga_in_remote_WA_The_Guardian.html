Please keep your eyes open!!”</p><p>Wilga is slim, with long wavy brown hair, brown eyes, and tattoos including symbols on her left arm.</p><img src="images/694_9198205385566271900.jpg" alt="Carolina Wilga in her Mitsubishi Delica van" class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Carolina Wilga was known to be in the Beacon area in Western Australia’s Wheatbelt.Photograph: Western Australia police force</p><p>The day before the Beacon sighting, Wilga went to a convenience store in Toodyay, which is also in the Wheatbelt region.</p><p>Venn said police were taking the case “very seriously” but that it was also possible Wilga was visiting picturesque, but “very remote” tourist spots.</p><p>“She could be off-grid, not have access to her phone, and she certainly had the capacity in the vehicle she was travelling in to be self-sufficient for quite some time,” Venn said.</p><p>“[Her] family are understandably distraught, very worried, as any of us would be with a young family member the other side of the world, missing in such unusual circumstances.</p><p>“Someone out there must have some vital information which can assist WA police in bringing Carolina back to her family and friends.”</p><p>Police have urged anyone with information to make contact.</p><p>They have also asked anyone with footage in Beacon or the surrounding north-east Wheatbelt area between 29 June and 4 July to upload it directly here .</p>
