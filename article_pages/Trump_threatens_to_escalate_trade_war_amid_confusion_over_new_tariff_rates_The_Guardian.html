            <p>Donald Trump vowed to further escalate his trade wars on Tuesday, threatening US tariffs of up to 200% on foreign drugs and 50% on copper, amid widespread confusion around his shifting plans.</p><p>Hours after saying his latest deadline for a new wave of steep duties was “not 100% firm”, the US president declared that “no extensions will be granted” beyond 1 August.</p><p>“There has been no change to this date, and there will be no change,” Trump wrote on social media, a day after signing an executive order that changed the date from 9 July.</p><p>On Monday, he announced plans to impose US tariffs of up to 40% on goods imported from 14 countries, including Bangladesh, Japan and South Korea. But he extended a pause on the duties’ introduction, allowing three more weeks for negotiations.</p><p>More letters will be sent to countries, informing them of new tariff rates “today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time”, according to Trump.</p><p>Global stock markets have largely shrugged off the latest threats. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 was up just 0.03% and the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.3%. In recent weeks, some investors appear to have embraced the Taco – or Trump Always Chickens Out – trade.</p><p>Speaking on Tuesday at the White House, Trump laid out plans to step up his controversial trade strategy, which economists have warned risks exacerbating inflation.</p><p>Imported copper will face a US tariff of 50% in a bid to bolster US production of the metal, the administration announced. US copper prices rose 12% to hit record levels.</p><p>After providing manufacturers with around a year or a year and a half’s notice, pharmaceutical imports are also “going to be tariffed at a very, very high rate”, the president said. “Like 200%.”</p><p>“We’re going to be announcing pharmaceuticals, chips and various couple of other things – you know, big ones,” he added, of the administration’s tariff plans.</p>
