            <p>Athletic Bilbao’s Yeray Álvarez has been provisionally suspended because of a failed doping test after a Europa League game against Manchester United, with the defender saying he unintentionally ingested a banned substance in medicine used to treat hair loss.</p><p>Álvarez said he had tested positive after Bilbao’s 3-0 home defeat in the semi-finals of Uefa’s second-tier club competition in May. The Spanish side also lost the return leg 4-1.</p><p>The 30-year-old centre-back was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2016 and said he had been taking the medicine as part of his treatment for alopecia.</p><p>“After studying the case, we have established that I tested positive because I unintentionally took a hair loss prevention medicine containing a banned substance,” Álvarez said in a social media post on Thursday.</p><p>“The disciplinary procedure is currently under investigation and subject to confidentiality, so I am provisionally suspended and am not authorised to make any further public statements.</p><p>“I would like to say to all of you that I very much regret this situation but, with the support of the club, I am working on my defence in the belief that I will be able to return to the field of play as soon as possible.”</p><p>Uefa said it would not comment on the case until a final disciplinary decision had been made.</p><p>Bilbao threw their full support behind Álvarez, who came through the club’s youth academy and has made 257 appearances in all competitions for the senior team.</p>
