            <p>WK Kellogg on Thursday agreed to be bought by the owner of Ferrero Rocher in a deal worth around $3.1bn, as the cereal maker has been struggling with weakening consumer demand due to persistently high inflation.</p><p>Deal making in the snacking space has picked up pace as food brands battle muted sales in the wake of price hikes owing to higher input costs and a shift in consumer preference for healthier options.</p><p>Ferrero has offered WK Kellogg’s shareholders $23 per share, representing a 31% premium to the stock’s close on Wednesday. Shares of the cereal maker were up 30% at $22.70 in premarket trading on Thursday.</p><p>The deal, which is Ferrero’s biggest acquisition in recent years, brings legacy brands such as Nutella, Kinder, Tic Tac, Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops and Special K under one roof.</p><p>Late on Wednesday, a source told Reuters that the candy maker behind Nutella was nearing a deal to buy WK Kellogg.</p><p>At the time, Jefferies analysts said that the magnitude of the premium was a surprise and would make it hard to envision another bidder coming forward or a deal rejection.</p><p>WK Kellogg was spun off from Kellanova and holds the North American cereal business of Kellogg, the original parent. Meanwhile, Cheez-It maker Kellanova is in the process of being acquired by candy giant Mars in a nearly $36bn deal.</p><p>WK Kellogg and other packaged food companies have flagged subdued demand due to cautious consumer spending in the US following consistent price increases by firms trying to navigate higher input costs.</p><p>Packaged food makers are also under pressure from health hecretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s “Make America healthy again” commission to eliminate the use of synthetic dyes.</p><p>The maker of Nutella hazelnut spread, Ferrero, has turned into a global group, boosted by the aggressive acquisition campaign launched by its executive chair Giovanni Ferrero.</p><p>In 2018, Ferrero bought Nestlé’s US confectionery business for $2.8bn. The group reported a turnover of €18.4bn ($19.2bn) in the financial year ending on 31 August and said it had increased its investments to boost manufacturing capabilities and expand across categories.</p><p>The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.</p>
