            <p>The FTSE 100 index of the most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange has soared to a new record high as investors shrugged off concerns over Donald Trump’s trade wars .</p><p>The FTSE 100 had the 9,000-point mark in its sights on Thursday, as it climbed to 8,973 points, above its previous all-time high of 8,908 points.</p><p>Stocks rose in London amid a global rally, as traders grew confident that Trump would either reach agreements with US trading partners, or again delay or dial back his threatened tariffs.</p><p>Mining stocks led the FTSE 100 risers, with Anglo American up more than 5%, closely followed by Glencore and Rio Tinto.</p><p>Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: “Commodities are fuelling the gains for the FTSE 100, with copper in the green and gold catching a bid on the back of a weaker US dollar.”</p><p>The blue-chip share index has now risen by more than 9% during 2025, having recovered from sharp losses in early April when markets tumbled after Trump announced new tariffs on what he called “liberation day” , before recovering after he postponed them.</p><p>The precious metals producer Fresnillo has been the top-performing FTSE 100 stock so far this year; its shares are up 140% since 1 January, driven by gains in the prices of gold and silver.</p><p>The British defence company Babcock’s share price has doubled so far this year, while weapons-maker BAE Systems is up 63% year-to-date, helped by expectations of a surge in defence spending as the Russia-Ukraine war continued.</p><p>Shares have pushed higher this week despite Trump announcing new tariff rates that will be imposed on imports from 1 August – postponed from a previous date of 9 July.</p><p>Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at IG, said investors were in an “ebullient summer mood”.</p><p>“Perhaps most notable is the market’s apparent indifference to escalating trade tensions. Trump’s 50% tariff on copper imports and threats toward Brazil triggered little reaction. Many now view such announcements as political posturing, summed up by Taco: Trump always chickens out,” he said.</p><p>Germany’s DAX share index also hit a record high on Thursday. It has gained more than 23% so far this year, lifted by plans from the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, to increase government spending to drive investment and lift growth.</p><p>The FTSE 100 is seen as a gauge of optimism about the world economy, as many of the largest companies listed in London have a global focus.</p><p>Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The FTSE 100 is stuffed full of multinationals which are sensitive to the outlook for the world economy and with the so-called ‘Taco trade’ in full swing, it’s benefiting from more optimism around.</p><p>“Investors expect that Trump will ‘chicken out’ from imposing his threat,” Streeter added.</p>
