            <p>A woman has suffered significant injuries after being bitten by an animal at a Queensland zoo.</p><p>The woman, in her 50s, was attacked at Darling Downs zoo, in Pilton, about 50km south of Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, at about 8.32am on Sunday.</p><p>The woman was reportedly watching keepers working when she was attacked. The zoo is home to big cats including lions, tigers and leopards.</p><p>A spokesperson for Queensland ambulance said the woman suffered a “significant arm injury”.</p><ul><li>Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</li></ul><p>The Life Flight rescue helicopter flew her to the Princess Alexandra hospital where she is reportedly in a stable condition.</p><p>In a statement on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, the Darling Downs Zoo said the woman was watching keepers working in the carnivore precinct when the attack happened.</p><p>“This is something that she has done many, many times over the past 20 years. She is well versed in safety protocols around potentially dangerous animals.</p><p>“Inexplicably, at this stage, one animal grabbed her by one arm and caused severe damage to it. At no stage did this animal leave [its] enclosure and there was no risk at all to staff members or members of the public.”</p><p>The zoo said the woman was currently being operated on and that police and workplace health and safety personnel were investigating.</p><p>“The zoo is working with them to establish how this incident occurred but the full details will not be known until our family member can be interviewed.”</p><p>“We are extremely grateful to the QAS [Queensland ambulance service], QPS [Queensland police service] and LifeFlight for their prompt attendance and to all of the people and organisations who have rallied round us with messages of support.”</p><p>In a follow-up post, the zoo clarified that the “injured person was not one of our immediate family nor a keeper”.</p><p>“The animal involved was not an animal which has recently cubbed. The animal will definitely not be put down or punished in any way,” it said.</p><p>A spokesperson from Workplace Health and Safety Queensland confirmed it was onsite and making inquiries.</p><p>The zoo said it would be closed all day on Sunday but would re-open at 9am on Monday.</p><p>The zoo has African lions, including white lions from the Greater Timbavati and Southern Kruger Park region of South Africa. It also has other big cats including a Sumatran tiger and a breeding pair of Sri Lankan leopards, according to its website.</p><p>The zoo turns 20 this year and has appointed a “restructuring practitioner” to help “make our commercial structure more fit for purpose” according to the website.</p><p>“The zoo specialises in the captive husbandry and breeding of many critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable species from around the world,” the website says.</p>
