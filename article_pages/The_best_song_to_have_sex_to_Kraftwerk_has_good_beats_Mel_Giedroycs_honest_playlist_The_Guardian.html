            <p>The first song I remember hearing My mum was a massive Beatles fan. I remember, pretty much every day after school from the age of five, coming home and putting on Eleanor Rigby, because I loved the storytelling. The idea of a face that you keep in a jar by the door haunted me, and “all the lonely people” was just too much.</p><p>The first single I bought I got 2p a week pocket money – it was in the 70s. My older sister and I went halves on Bo Rap [Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen], which cost 30p on seven-inch, from a record shop in Epsom. I’d heard it on Top of the Pops and I must have listened to it seven times a day.</p><p>The song I do at karaoke I think I am a better singer than I actually am. I’ve made the tragic karaoke mistake of choosing The Winner Takes It All by Abba, which is fricking hard to sing. I’ll stick with I Love Rock’n’Roll by Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts, which is far more in my comfort zone. Or, if with my husband, Don’t You Want Me by the Human League – that went down well at my nephew’s wedding.</p><p>The song I inexplicably know every lyric to I was in B&amp;Q and found that I knew all the words to The Safety Dance by Men Without Hats. I know a lot of words to 80s songs, but on that one I’m word perfect.</p><p>The best song to play at a party I wouldn’t play Firestarter by the Prodigy at the neighbours’ Christmas drinks until at least 10pm. But Video Killed the Radio Star by the Buggles straddles all parties.</p><p>The song I secretly like My husband and two daughters are rude about Coldplay, so I pretend to be the same. But Atlas, from the Hunger Games soundtrack, is definitely on my playlist.</p><p>The song I can no longer listen to I didn’t pass my driving test until I was 30, and bought an old, powder-blue 1974 BMW. I had a CD player installed and would blast out Hey Boy Hey Girl by the Chemical Brothers, thinking I was cool. I’m not a cool person.</p><p>The best song to have sex to Trans-Europe Express by Kraftwerk has a good beat.</p><p>The song that makes me cry Born Slippy (Nuxx) by Underworld takes me back to the 1996 Edinburgh festival, hanging out with my beloved comedy partner Perks [Sue Perkins], cutting shapes on the dancefloor, not giving a toss about what we looked like. It makes me cry because I’m nearly 57.</p><p>The song I’d like played at my funeral The whole of the Jesus Christ Superstar album, especially Heaven on Their Minds, the one with the amazing bassline.</p><p>Mel Giedroyc hosts the podcast Where There’s a Will, There’s a Wake.</p>
