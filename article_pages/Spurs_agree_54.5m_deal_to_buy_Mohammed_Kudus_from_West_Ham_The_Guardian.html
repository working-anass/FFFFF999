            <p>Tottenham have reached an agreement to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £54.5m.</p><p>Kudus is due to undergo a medical on Thursday and will sign a six-year deal. The Ghana attacker will become the first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker in 2011.</p><p>West Ham’s decision to sell Kudus to their London rivals is down to their needing to revamp their squad without inviting a potential breach of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations. Sources at the London Stadium are adamant that West Ham must sell to buy . They want a goalkeeper, a left centre-back, a left wing-back, at least two midfielders and a striker.</p><p>Kudus had an £85m release clause valid for Premier League sides for the first 10 days of July but West Ham were always likely to accept a lower fee. He was deemed the club’s most sellable asset and has attracted plenty of interest. Spurs have made the strongest push for the 24-year-old and had a £50m bid rejected last week. The payment is to be spread over three years.</p><p>West Ham are comfortable with allowing Kudus to leave, reasoning that he is best playing on the right – the same position as the captain, Jarrod Bowen. Graham Potter does not feel that Kudus is capable of playing in a central role in the Premier League.</p><p>Kudus impressed after joining West Ham from Ajax for £37m two years ago but struggled last season. He clashed with Potter’s predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and managed four goals in all competitions. He served a lengthy ban after a red card during a 4-1 defeat by Spurs last October.</p><p>That dismissal has not stopped Tottenham from going for him. Kudus will boost Thomas Frank’s options in the final third and his arrival represents a show of intent as Spurs look to rebuild after replacing Ange Postecoglou with the Dane.</p>
