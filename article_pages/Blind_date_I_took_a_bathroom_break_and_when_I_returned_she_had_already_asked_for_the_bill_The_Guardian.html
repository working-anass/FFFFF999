An interesting and sparky guy who had similar tastes and interests, and a sense of fun.</p><p>First impressions? A bit nervous, like me, and as we’d both got lost finding the place, we chatted about that initially.</p><p>What did you talk about? Working in the time of Covid. Changing careers and moving into more creative roles. We even touched on whether there are extraterrestrial beings visiting us … and agreed this is highly likely! I learned a lot about Michael.</p><p>Most awkward moment? I didn’t think to introduce myself and Michael had to ask me my name at the end of the date!</p><p>Good table manners? We shared our plates as expected, so yes.</p><p>Best thing about Michael? He’s open and honest, told me a lot about himself and seemed trusting.</p><p>Would you introduce Michael to your friends? If it was the right situation, but this seems unlikely.</p><p>Describe Michael in three words Low-key, calm and real.</p><p>What do you think Michael made of you? That I’m a Londoner who talks a lot.</p><p>Did you go on somewhere? No, it was chilly so we got the bill and headed to the station.</p><p>And … did you kiss? On a first date? Never!</p><p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I’d have been wrapped up in a cosy jacket and felt warmer, or we’d have sparked off each other to keep warm.</p><p>Marks out of 10? 6.</p><p>Would you meet again? No, we didn’t have the necessary electricity between us.</p><img src="images/2316_4306165045273356635.jpg" alt="Rebecca and Michael" class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Rebecca and Michael on their date.</p><img src="images/1790_7802547829491293454.jpg" alt="Michael" class="rounded-lg"><h2>Michael on Rebecca</h2><p>What were you hoping for? A flirty, fun, lighthearted evening.</p><p>First impressions? Something about her reminded me of an old flame – I was instantly attracted.</p><p>What did you talk about? She set out her Extinction Rebellion stall. I subjected her to a rambling assessment of the current UFO narrative and the possibility of NHI (non-human intelligence).</p><p>Most awkward moment? I took a bathroom break. When I returned Becky had already asked for the bill, thwarting my plans for cheesecake. She had spotted some travel issues so wanted to get going.</p><p>Good table manners? Ladylike and assured.</p><p>Best thing about Becky? She is attractive, with a sureness that permeates everything she says and does.</p><p>Would you introduce Becky to your friends? Definitely.</p><p>Describe Becky in three words Assured. Petite. Mysterious.</p><p>What do you think Becky made of you? I was a nervous wreck to start, so she probably thought I was all over the place.</p><p>Did you go on somewhere? To Waterloo … turns out I had a one‑way ticket.</p><p>And … did you kiss? A hug goodbye at the ticket barriers.</p><p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I’d remember how to flirt and she would have stayed for dessert and had ice-cream, à la Meg Ryan.</p><p>Marks out of 10? 8.</p><p>Would you meet again? I asked for her number but she declined. She didn’t think we had a connection.</p><p>Michael and Rebecca ate at Parrillan King’s Cross, London N1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com</p>
